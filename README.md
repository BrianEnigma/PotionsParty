# Random Notes

- Need small test-tube racks so students can carry their ingredients to a mixing station? Probably, yes. Simple, small. Rectangular? Circular? Looks worn, like it caught on fire once?  **<--- LOVE THIS!!** 
- Goblet of fire? What would it be for? Decoration? Put name in for some reason?  (3D printing? Sculpted?)
- Triwizard cup?
- House decor (see detailed ideas in [Decor](,Decor))

- Dry Ice / Smoking Effect
    - Not for drinks for safety, but in a centerpiece, we can put it in a glass test tube in the center of ??? for the smoking effect and for safety.



# Lessons Learned

Many of the individual projects have their own “lessons learned” sections, but overarching lessons for the whole party go here:

- Hire a professional photographer.
- Hire a professional bartender.
