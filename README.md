# Potions Party

While this party is inspired by the young-adult series of magic school books, we do distance ourselves from it for both legal and social reasons. The legal reasons should be obvious. On the social side, the author of the wizarding school books has repeatedly shown herself to be a Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist ([TERF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERF)). She is transphobic and rejects the assertion that transgender women are women. We cannot get behind that kind of hateful attitude.

## Random Notes

- Need small test-tube racks so students can carry their ingredients to a mixing station? Probably, yes. Simple, small. Rectangular? Circular? Looks worn, like it caught on fire once?  **<--- LOVE THIS!!**
- Goblet of fire? What would it be for? Decoration? Put name in for some reason?  (3D printing? Sculpted?)
- Triwizard cup?

- Dry Ice / Smoking Effect
    - Not for drinks for safety, but in a centerpiece, we can put it in a glass test tube in the center of ??? for the smoking effect and for safety.

## Lessons Learned

Many of the individual projects have their own “lessons learned” sections, but overarching lessons for the whole party go here:

- Hire a professional photographer.
- Hire a bartender.

We fixed those things in the second year's run of the party.
